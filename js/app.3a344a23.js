So much so that many of them will take easier alternate trails to avoid it, that\'s how much they fear this slab of ice. Obviously it loses a little of its luster as the summer rolls on.","title":"Day 3","img":"/img/cdt-2012/9-13-12c.jpg"},"9":{"caption":"","include_post":true,"id":"9","latitude":"","longitude":"","date":"9-13-12","text":"I believe this was the end of the highline trail for me.

To get here you start out on a nice forest service road, which was fine, but then that nice road turned into a crappy road, which turned into barely a road, but you could still follow it. At that point you had to turn right onto a \'road\' that hasn\'t seen anything other than cows in decades (and it\'s not marked), so you\'re not exactly sure it\'s your road, but you take it anyway because what else are you going to do? Then this cow trail disappears and you\'re left bushwacking through the shrubs along a creek, but every now and then there are bits of trail, so it\'s ok. Then you have to turn right onto a trail, which of course is not marked, but you turn right anyway, because what else are you going to do? Then after a few hundred yards that trail disappears, but it\'s ok because in this area there are orange snowmobile diamonds to follow, so that\'s fine, but you can\'t follow them forever because eventually you have to turn left and follow a creek. It\'s not marked, and at this point you\'re on the divide, so there\'s no creek way up there, you just have to guess where there *might* be a creek further down the mountain, but you turn left anyway, because what else are you going to do? You get lucky and there is a creek, but you don\'t really know if it\'s *your* creek because there\'s no trail, but you follow it anyway. Eventually you see faint signs of an old road, and you\'re so happy to see anything man-made that you run for it not caring where it leads, but it eventually turns into a nicer road that ends up at Fish Lake Pass and is actually the road you see in this picture.

My tent has seen better days (in all fairness to the tent, it has lasted through 1 1/2 thru hikes and a cross-country bike trip or two - fairly impressive) and is now starting to leak. Not a trait you want in a tent. Anyway, the point is that everything I had was wet: the tent, sleeping bag, clothes, everything. It wasn\'t cold enough to where it was dangerous, I just basically felt like I was starting to mold. Ugh. A day to dry out was needed to preserve my sanity. Luckily, I was in Matsue, which has a huge, awesome castle in the middle of it. Japan has a lot of castles, I like that about this place.","title":"Day 10 - Matsue","img":"/img/japan-2015/4-20-15.jpg"},"1152699355798006235":{"caption":"The Tottori Sand Dunes.","include_post":true,"id":"1152699355798006235","latitude":"35.536","longitude":"134.225","date":"2015-04-21 07:14:52","text":"This was one of my favorite days in Japan.

I decided that it was more important to see and experience things like Kyoto than to stubbornly stay on the road and bike just to bike. Anyway, the point is that for the first time I had a goal, and suddenly everything changed. I wasn\'t sure if this was a good thing or not, but I seem to do a lot better with a mission; random wandering does not seem to agree with me, which I found quite surprising. The point is that Kyoto is in the middle of the country, which meant that I would have to leave my wonderful coast behind and start riding up into the mountains. If anyone out there is not familiar with Japan, it\'s not exactly what I would call a \\"flat\\" country. There are mountains. Lots of mountains.

These aren\'t nice Korean tunnels that are only open to pedestrians, oh no, these are highways through the mountain. Sometimes there\'s a sidewalk through the tunnel, but most of the time it\'s just you and the traffic. Now to be fair, Japanese drivers are some of the most courteous drivers I have ever seen. If you\'re riding up a hill and there\'s a big truck behind you and there\'s not enough room to safely pass because of the oncoming traffic, they will slow down and wait until it\'s safe to pass. Really. It\'s amazing, I\'ve never seen anything like it. The same is true at crosswalks. If the little crosswalk sign is red, Japanese people will sit there and wait until it turns green before they walk across, even if it takes an hour and there isn\'t a car for miles. They. Will. Wait. Again, it\'s amazing and something I never see anywhere else. Yay Japan! What was my point? Oh yeah, the tunnels. Terrifying. Even with courteous drivers. I took this picture because of the sign in front of the tunnel, it gives the length, ~1700 meters. That\'s 1.7 kilometers. That\'s just over a mile. In a tunnel. On a bike. Absolutely horrible. So if there was an old road that went up and over a pass instead of through the tunnel, you better believe that I took it. Plus a road like that is quiet and peaceful, actually a lovely bike ride.

The real highlight of Kyoto was not the shrines and temples, but the people I met. I stayed at a hostel, which, yes, is cheap accommodation, but the real perk of the hostel experience are the other travelers you meet. I met 2 guys (one from Australia, one from Scotland) who were working at a ski resort on Hokkaido (the northern island of Japan). The ski season was over, so they were just traveling around Japan for a few weeks before heading home. Later, I met a couple from Ireland who were doing an 8-month round-the-world trip. 8 months!!

There are bright lights, signs and people everywhere, I loved it. You\'ve gotta be careful of which part of town you\'re walking around in though. Not because it\'s unsafe, I never felt unsafe in Tokyo, just awkward. Let me explain. I was somewhere near the Shibuya crossing (that famous super-busy street crossing from movies like \'Lost in Translation\'). I was walking down the street and suddenly this pretty girl is talking to me. At first, I thought she was begging for money, because that\'s what I\'m use to in big cities, but she was way too put together for that. Then I thought she was trying to sell me something, but I couldn\'t quite understand what she was saying, so I kept on walking. Turns out she was trying to sell me something, I was just too stupid to realize it. Anyway, after she backed off, another girl came up to me. This was when I started feeling weird. She was also saying things in English that I could barely understand, but then all at once I distinctly heard her say \'blowjob\', which caused me to do a double take, but I kept on walking. A minute later was another girl, with much better English, and this time it was: \'massage. handjob. blowjob. free to look.\' Over and over again. They were very persistent. Was there something about me that screamed: \'Hey, this guy would totally pay to have some poor Japanese girl do stuff to him\'? Because there could be a decent number of people on the sidewalk and they would always target me. Why?!? Hopefully it was because I was obviously a tourist, by myself, and in what appeared to be the red-light district of Tokyo. This is what happens when you just randomly walk around a city.

Yes, that\'s really my logic, I was ridiculously close to what was probably one of the most scared places in Korea and I was debating if I should ride the 1 kilometer extra to see it. I laugh now, but I really did debate it at the time. Anyway, I\'m so glad I went, it\'s a beautiful compound, right on the river, and there were only a handful of tourists there, a stark contrast to the shrines in Japan, but of course I didn\'t know that at the time. I just wandered around the place for an hour, it was incredible. I even bought a little souvenir, which I almost never do. Towards the end of the day there was another temple, this one was right on the path, but it involved climbing up a hill, so of course, again there was that debate in my head - what do I do? Ugh, you\'d think I would learn by now: Just go. You almost never regret just going. This temple was Jeongsimga, or something like that. Much smaller than Silleuksa, and I was the only person there. Probably because you had to climb up a mountain to get to it. What is it with temples, you always have to climb something or travel a long ways to get to them. You\'d think when they built the things a thousand years ago that they would have considered the needs of the lazy American tourist, but no, they just put their temple on top of the mountain like they didn\'t care at all. That was sarcasm, by the way, just in case anyone missed that. Regardless, that was my second day in Korea: Experiencing my first temples, and like most things, the first ones will always be the best. No really, Silleuksa was my favorite of the entire trip.

I have no idea what that something else is because I still don\'t read Korean, but whatever it was led me about an hour off course before I finally figured out that I wasn\'t where I was suppose to be. Oh well, getting lost is all part of the fun. The good part of this day was that I got to meet other guys biking the path. We kept running into each other throughout the day and finally towards evening Mr. Kim (who barely speaks English) asked me if I wanted Maki - Korean wine. I wasn\'t exactly sure what he was planning, but when someone invites you to drink Korean wine, I decided that it\'s best to just say yes and hope for the best. We ended up at some restaurant eating dinner and drinking, and my new Korean friends got a huge laugh at watching me attempt to use chop sticks, so it was good fun all around. Their English wasn\'t great, but as far as I could tell for dinner we had the standard kimchi with pickled onion and then spicy pig neck with rice. Delicious.

The nice thing about the bike path is that it follows the rivers, so it mostly bypasses a lot of towns, or at least the main parts of towns. If you want to go into the town properly, you have to turn off of the path intentionally, so at least once a day, usually more, I turn off when a spot looks interesting and see what happens. Usually I\'m just looking for a grocery store to buy food and snacks for the day, but it\'s also fun to just wander around checking everything out. Korean towns are awesome because you never know what you\'ll find. For example, in one town they were having some sort of festival with lots of booths selling food, souvenirs, etc. It was a definite carnival-like atmosphere. Anyway, I turned the corner and wandered by this tent where they were playing music, inside were people in traditional costumes and they were singing: \\"Dancing in the moonlight\\". Seriously.

I knew there was a ferry, but I had no idea where to find it. Somewhere along the ocean was my best guess, but didn\'t get me very far. Luckily I found a guy who spoke no English but tried really hard to help me (thank you Google Translate!), and eventually I found the \'domestic\' ferry, only to cry a little in frustration when I realized I needed the \'international\' ferry. Whatever, I figured it out after awhile. Then came the task of trying to buy an actual ticket. In order to get into Japan I needed to prove that I had a flight out, which was no problem, but I also needed an address of where I was staying. \'But I\'m biking and camping\' was not an acceptable answer to that question. So I had to book a hotel for a night. I eventually canceled it, but it\'s still annoying. That poor girl at the ticket counter, I probably tried and failed at least 3 times to buy a simple ferry ticket, but eventually, eventually I got one.

Anyway, she had quite the spread, she just kept pulling more and more stuff out of her vehicle:  ham, croissants, fruit, carrots, cookies, candy, I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a trail magic quite like that.  I was almost expecting to turn around and see her pulling some freshly baked muffins out of a secret oven in her car.  The moral here folks is if you ever want to amaze and delight hikers just drive to the trail, set up camp for the day (a few lawn chairs will do), and feed some hikers.

However, they have a bunk room for thru-hikers for 10 bucks a night, which is acceptable.  The reason I bring this up is that this hut is the last option for a place to sleep on the trail for 14 miles (because everything is above treeline in this section and camping is forbidden). Anyway, the plan was to stay at the hut and hike the above treeline section tomorrow.  I got to the hut around 5pm and they were still \'setting up\' for the season.

Is it just dumb luck that I\'m still out here hiking and she\'s gone?  I don\'t know.  I do know that it\'s really easy to analyze her decisions and actions and try to find the flaw that caused everything.  If something horrible happened to me would people analyze me looking for that one critical hiker rule that I broke and use it as a cautionary tale?  Probably.  I think we should take a different approach though.

Once finished, they were out there and running, but it wasn\'t easy to see their current state, so I created a system to display the current status of these processes.  The idea was that you would give it a schedule and the healthcheck would ping an API endpoint to let it know that it was successful.

Here\'s the short summary:  In a lab, there are a lot of critical values that MUST be called to the nurse or doctor taking care of a patient (like a critically low glucose value, something like that).  The problem is that sometimes you can get 10 of these things at the same time.  It\'s not really possible to call 10 nurses at the same time, so you call one and the other 9 sit there and wait.  My idea was to create an application so that you can log those calls, they show up in a list, and anyone in that lab can help out by grabbing one of those items and making the call for you.  So the tech would create a new call item, it shows up under \'Available\', then someone else would click on it to bring it over to the \'InProgress\' side, and then when the call is complete you click on a button to send it to the \'Done\' list.","cardTech":"The front end is Vue JS and the backend is Go.","cardImg":"/img/portfolio-img/callhelper.png"},"6":{"id":"6","tabTitle":"Spanish Vocab","cardTitle":"Spanish Vocab Review","cardText":"This one is just another fun little side project for myself.

The guy driving it would be standing there announcing his destination, you paid him, and when his van filled up he left.  Simple in theory, difficult when you don\'t speak the language.  However, that was the first bus (to Ramala, maybe?  It\'s been awhile).  Then there was another minibus to the turnoff to Cachora, then a taxi to Cachora itself.  Cachora is the last town before the hike.  It\'s possible to get even further by car, but that\'s not as easy, unless you\'re paying for the guided trek, where they do all the work for you.  I wasn\'t.  So all-in-all, not terrible, but not particually easy either.
