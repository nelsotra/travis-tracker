That's the problem with something that's not descended upon by millions of tourists each year, you have to work a little harder to see it.  Anyway, it took a series of buses to get there; this was the process:  I woke up early, before sunrise, and wandered around looking for the bus station.  I was expecting actual buses, but no, the 'bus station' was a road with a handful of mini-vans parked along it.  The guy driving it would be standing there announcing his destination, you paid him, and when his van filled up he left.  Simple in theory, difficult when you don't speak the language.  However, that was the first bus (to Ramala, maybe?  It's been awhile).  Then there was another minibus to the turnoff to Cachora, then a taxi to Cachora itself.  Cachora is the last town before the hike.  It's possible to get even further by car, but that's not as easy, unless you're paying for the guided trek, where they do all the work for you.  I wasn't.  So all-in-all, not terrible, but not particually easy either.  It does make for a nice story though, and I'll always have the memory of the nice local Peruvian guy who fell asleep on my shoulder as we were driving to Ramala.  Good times.",

The easiest way was to wait for one of those guided tours to either drop people off or pick people up and then hope and pray that they have an extra seat.  Luckily, this one did.  I obviously had to pay the seat, but a guaranteed ride all the way back to Cusco is definitely worth it.",
